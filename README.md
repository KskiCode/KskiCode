- 👋 Hi, I’m @KskiCode
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning and Deep Learning
- 💞️ I like to work with TensorFlow, Keras and scikit-learn. Recently I got a little in touch with PyTorch. 


I am currently working on projects in the field of Process Mining where I use different OCR and Computer Vision tools.
